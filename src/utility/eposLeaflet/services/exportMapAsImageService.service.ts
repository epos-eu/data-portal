   * 2. Iterates over the `blobs` array and adds each blob to the ZIP archive.
   * 3. Generates the ZIP file as a Blob and triggers its download using the `saveAs` function.

   * - This method relies on the `JSZip` library for ZIP file creation and the `saveAs` function for file download.
   * - Ensure that `mapReady` and `legendsReady` are properly set before invoking this method.
   * - The `blobs` array should contain objects with `name` and `blob` properties.
