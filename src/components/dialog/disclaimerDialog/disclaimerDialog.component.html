      <p>The data, information and related records supplied in this Report by BGS can only be indicative and should not
        be
        taken as a substitute for specialist interpretations, professional advice and/or detailed site investigations.
        You
        must seek professional advice before making technical interpretations on the basis of the material provided.</p>
      <p>Geological observations are made according to the prevailing understanding of the subject at the time. The
        quality of such observations may be affected by subsequent advances in knowledge or improved methods of
        interpretation and better access to sampling locations.</p>
      <p>Raw data may have been transcribed from analogue to digital format, or may have been acquired by means of
        automated measuring techniques. Although such processes are subjected to quality control to ensure reliability
        where possible, some raw data may have been processed without human intervention and may in consequence contain
        undetected errors.</p>
      <p>Detail, which is clearly defined and accurately depicted on large-scale maps, may be lost when small-scale maps
        are derived from them.</p>
      <p>Although samples and records are maintained with all reasonable care, there may be some deterioration in the
        long
        term.</p>
      <p>The most appropriate techniques for copying original records are used, but there may be some loss of detail and
        dimensional distortion when such records are copied.</p>
      <p>Data may be compiled from the disparate sources of information at BGS's disposal, including material donated to
        BGS by third parties, and may not originally have been subject to any verification or other quality control
        process.</p>
      <p>Data, information and related records that have been donated to BGS have been produced for a specific purpose,
        and that may affect the type and completeness of the data recorded and any interpretation. The nature and
        purpose
        of data collection, and the age of the resultant material may render it unsuitable for certain
        applications/uses.
      </p>
      <p>If a report or other output is produced for you on the basis of data you have provided to BGS, or your own data
        input into a BGS system, please do not rely on it as a source of information about other areas or geological
        features, as the report may omit important details.</p>
      <p>The topography shown on any map extracts is based on the latest OS mapping and is not necessarily the same as
        that used in the original compilation of the BGS geological map, and to which the geological linework available
        at
        that time was fitted.</p>
      <p>Note that for some sites, the latest available records may be quite historical in nature, and while every
        effort
        is made to place the analysis in a modern geological context, it is possible in some cases that the detailed
        geology at a site may differ from that described.</p>
