## [0.3.0]

## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-08 - Rome Review

### Refactored
- Refactored code to use Angular4
- Single page application for better user experience, code structure, shared data, modules and state.
- Data driven, user interface bound to data changes.
- Created reusable, loosely coupled components
- Created internal data model
- Created internal services for reusable functionality
- Can switch to different input data sources (Web API / JSON files)
- Used TypeScript to for improved object-oriented programming and fully typed objects
- Continuous linting of code
- End to end tests
- Performance tests
- Unit tests on some key modules
- Continuous integration pipelines with automated integration tests to ensure code quality and improving merging and prevent regressions.

### Development Workflow Established
- identify issue/feature
- create branch
- code
- lint
- test
- deploy to dev
- performance test
- independent review
- integrate to master
- test
- deploy live
- check performance

### Deployment
- Automated publishing to development environment
- Manual push to live environment BGS hosted
- Manual push to live docker image and BRGM hosting

### Search
- Search tabs removed in favour of generic search pane
- Resource types now using toggle switch instead of drop down box?
- Domains, datatypes and keywords are populated from the API
- Added keywords dropbox box selector
- Added progress spinner on search

### Search Results Table
- Remove DataTables dependency
- Table item actions are dynamically created from data attributes
- Removed internal scrollbars from table?
- Table data populated from the API data
- 'View information' action displays summary information, description, any web service parameters and the raw data.
- 'Add to workspace' action allows the user to add the item to a new or existing workspace and provide web service parameters

### Search Results Mini Map
Map data populated from the API search data
Added map bounding box extent selector
Changed base map to aerial photograph layer
Map extent also synchronised with spatial visualisation page

### Workspaces
- Removed previous workspaces page, can now change active workspace in the workspace content page
- Workspace content currently only stored temporarily (session state not stored)

### Not fully implemented
Spatial visualisation showing example data
Temporal and Processing model pages not implemented
